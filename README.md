<h1>CSV Stock Reader</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The project consists of a Windows Form app programmed in C# that reads CSV files containing information about stocks. The program uses classes and abstract classes to detect specific stock patterns such as marubozu, hammer, doji, and engulfing patterns. The user will import a CSV file into the "StockData" folder and be able to select the file based on the time period (ex. daily, monthly, or yearly), the stock ticker, and the start and end date. Once the file is loaded, it will display a fully plotted candlestick chart. The user will be able to select the specified pattern in the drop-down box in the new form window. The program will detect the selected pattern and create a text box over each.
